The present application is a management system for a university. The application is written entirely in Java, and makes use of Gradle, Java Swing, and Databases. I have also made a short (~9 min.) video presentation for the application, which can be viewed by following the link: https://youtu.be/35CZvLB5q9A 

As you would expect from such an application, it has three types of users: admins, professors, and students.

Admins can:
  
  1. log in to their accounts,
  2. change their passwords,
  3. create new accounts (all types),
  4. delete accounts (all types),
  5. change a course's professor.
  
Professors can:

  1. log in to their accounts,
  2. change their passwords,
  3. view the courses they are teaching,
  4. view their weekly schedule,
  5. add tasks for a course's students,
  6. view the given tasks of a course,
  7. schedule exams,
  8. view the scheduled exams,
  9. give grades,
  10. view the given grades.
  
Students can:
  
  1. log in to their accounts,
  2. change their passwords,
  3. view the courses they are enrolled for,
  4. view their weekly schedule,
  5. view a course's tasks,
  6. view scheduled exams,
  7. view their grades.
